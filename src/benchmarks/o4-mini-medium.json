What kind of application are you looking to build?  \n   • Web frontend (e.g. React, Vue)  \n   • Backend/API (e.g. Node/Express, Python/Flask, Go)  \n   • Full-stack (frontend + backend)  \n   • CLI tool, library, mobile app, etc.\n\n2. Which language or framework do you prefer?  \n   • JavaScript/TypeScript (Node, React, Next.js)  \n   • Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)  \n   • Java, Go, Ruby, etc.  \n\n3. Any specific features or integrations?  \n   • Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite)  \n   • Authentication, real-time (WebSocket), file uploads, scheduling  \n   • Docker, testing suite, CI/CD  \n\n4. Which package manager or build tools?  \n   • npm, yarn, pnpm  \n   • Bundler (Webpack, Vite), transpiler (Babel, TypeScript)  \n\nOnce I have those details, I’ll propose a concise plan, scaffold the project structure, implement the code, and deliver a comprehensive README so you can jump straight to running it.",
